<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Welcome to my website! </h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">This is a FNF website. You can play FNF without it being blocked. Even if this does get blocked, I can get around things.</p>
<p>Update! Nothing is here because its all blocked. Thankfully, I'm going to import and take some time to compile FNF mods so that all of you can play. Enjoy these placeholders for now.</p>
